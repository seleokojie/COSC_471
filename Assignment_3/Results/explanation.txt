In order to check whether a point was inside the triangle, 
We checked if it was inside a bounding box of the triangle.
If it was inside the bounding box, we checked if it was inside the triangle
using the barycentric coordinates.

In order to rasterize the triangle, we looped through all the pixels in the bounding box.
For each pixel, we checked if it was inside the triangle using the insideTriangle function.
If it was inside the triangle, we calculated the z value of the pixel using the barycentric coordinates.
We then checked if the z value of the pixel was less than the z value of the pixel in the z buffer.
If it was, we set the color of the pixel to the color of the triangle.

This allowed us to rasterize the triangle and check if it was inside the triangle.
